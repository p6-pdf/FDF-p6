NAME
====

FDF (Form Data Format) Trailer Dictionary

DESCRIPTION
===========

The trailer of an FDF file enables a reader to find significant objects quickly within the body of the file. The only required key is Root, whose value is an indirect reference to the fileâ€™s catalogue dictionary (see Table 242). The trailer may optionally contain additional entries for objects that are referenced from within the catalogue.

METHODS
=======

This class inherits from [PDF](PDF) and has most its methods available, including: `new`, `open`, `save-as`, `update`, `Str` and `Blob`.

Note that `encrypt` is not applicable to FDF files.
