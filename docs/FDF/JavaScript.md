An array defining additional JavaScript scripts that is added to those defined in the JavaScript entry of the documentâ€™s name dictionary. The array contains an even number of elements, organized in pairs. The first element of each pair is a name and the second is a text string or text stream defining the script corresponding to that name. Each of the defined scripts is added to those already defined in the name dictionary and is then executed before the script defined in the Before entry is executed.
